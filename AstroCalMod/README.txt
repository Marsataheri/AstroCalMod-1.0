This is the README file for the AstroCalMod GUI associated with the Yu, Taheri et al. (2020) paper and based on the mathematical model developed in the following papers:

Taheri M, Handy G, Borisyuk A, White JA (2017) Diversity of Evoked Astrocyte Ca2+ Dynamics Quantified through Experimental Measurements and Mathematical Modeling. Front Syst Neurosci.

Handy G, Taheri M, White JA, Borisyuk A (2017) Mathematical
Investigation of IP3-Dependent Calcium Dynamics in Astrocytes. J Comput Neurosci.

———————————————————————————

To run the GUI, first ensure that all files in the “AstroCalMod” folder are in the same folder and location on your computer. These files include this README file, “AstroCalMod.m”, and 3 folders (“CPA experiment functions”, “IP3-dependent functions”, “Supporting functions”) with their own set of Matlab files.


Next, open the file “AstroCalMod.m” in Matlab and click “Run”. The GUI will pop up with all functionality. For more help on how to use the GUI file, click on the “HELP” button in the lower right corner of the GUI.


To restart the GUI, please close it and repeat the steps above.
